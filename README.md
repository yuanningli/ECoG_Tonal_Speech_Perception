# ECoG_Tonal_Speech_Perception
We present a publicly available high-density ECoG dataset from four participants undergoing awake craniotomy who listened to continuous, sentence-level Mandarin Corpus. This resource supports fine-grained investigations of linguistic representations during naturalistic listening, providing a standardized benchmark for neural decoding models.
