# A Fine-grained Spatiotemporal ECoG Dataset during Speech Perception in Tonal Language

## Abstract
High-density intracranial recordings during naturalistic language processing are critical for advancing models of speech perception and for benchmarking neural decoding methods. However, open, well-annotated high-density ECoG resources for tonal languages remain scarce. We present a publicly available high-density ECoG dataset from four participants undergoing awake craniotomy who listened to continuous, sentence-level Mandarin drawn from the Annotated Speech Corpus of Chinese Discourse (ASCCD). Signals were recorded with 128–256-channel subdural grids and synchronized with the audio; high-gamma activity (70–150 Hz) was derived and downsampled to 400 Hz. The release follows BIDS-iEEG and is distributed as NWB files, with derivatives including word- and syllable-level alignments; Pinyin; lexical tone and stress tiers; prosodic break indices; mel-spectrograms; F0 and formants; and electrode localization on individual anatomy with projections to MNI space. This resource supports fine-grained investigations of lexical tone, syllabic structure, and higher-level linguistic representations during naturalistic listening, and provides a standardized benchmark for neural decoding and machine learning models.
